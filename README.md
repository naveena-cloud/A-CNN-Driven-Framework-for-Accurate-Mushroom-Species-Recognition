# A CNN-Driven Framework for Accurate Mushroom Species Recognition

## Description
A vision-based deep learning system that identifies specific mushroom species from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model recognizes species such as chicken of the woods, destroying angel, fly agaric, honey mushroom, lobster, oyster, leafy brain, and witch’s butter by learning visual features like shape, texture, and color.
